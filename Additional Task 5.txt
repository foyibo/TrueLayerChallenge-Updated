Additional Task 5

#Define a single line command to be run on your computer and to add your 
#ssh key to a remote computer. 

This question is not very clear to me, but below is the single line ssh command that
I will normally use to make a remote connection to an ssh enabled server using a 
public/private key cryptography.

It is very important that the ssh command is issued from the folder or location
where the key-pair (also known as identity file) is located, otherwise connection 
will not be establised especially when the -i flag is used. The -p flag for port-number
is optional except where the default port 22 has been changed on the server. 

 ssh -i /path/to-my-key-pair [-p] [port_number] user-name@server-name

ssh -i /path/to-identity-file [-p] [22] user-name@server-public-ipaddress




#Just adding the below single line commands 
#These implementations will depends on server configuration and other parameters

for passwordless connection:

~/path/to-my-key-pair# ssh [-p] [port_number] user-name@server-name

generating ssh keys
ssh-keygen

pushing key to server
ssh -T user@server-address
