#Describe the purpose of what is commonly called CAT EOF

CAT EOF is also known as 'here documents' or just as 'here-docs'. 

A here document is a special-purpose code block. It uses a form of 
I/O redirection to feed a command list to an interactive program or a command.
Commands such as ftp, cat, or the ex text editor can take advantage of these I/O 
redirections.

The EOF is a limit string that delineates (frames) the command list. 
The special symbol << precedes the limit string. This has the effect 
of redirecting the output of a command block into the stdin of the program or command.
While the output of the program or command can also be redirected or appended to a file.
The EOF is also known as here-tag. 

A here document supports parameter and command substitution. It is therefore 
possible to pass different parameters to the body of the here document, 
changing its output accordingly.

Please see my scripts (catEOFscript) for an example of this.
