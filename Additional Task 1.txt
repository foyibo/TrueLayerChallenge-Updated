#Addtional Task 1
#Scripts runs manually (interatively) by user but fails to run 
#non-interactively i.e. via crontab

LIKELY EXPLANATION

The Linux Shell behaves in slightly different ways when logged-in interactively 
versus non-interactively. 

This is because .profile or .bash_profile are only executed for interactive 
sessions. This subtle difference may be why something (a command, script, alias, etc) 
works perfectly when logged in interactively but there may be issues with the same 
command in non-interactive mode, as it may not be available in that mode. 

One way to resolve this is to configure the .bash_profile to reference .bashrc and 
put all of your configuration in .bashrc by using the source command or dot operator.

Also, it may be due to variable scope.
there are global environmental or system wide variables that may be referenced 
in a script these system-wide variables reside in the etc/profile, etc/bashrc, 
or the .bash_profile, and .bashrc in the user home directory. And changes to this 
variables would need to be exported to the current session so they are available 
to any process and sub processes that reference them.
